@article{Delorme2004,
	abstract = {We have developed a toolbox and graphic user interface, EEGLAB, running under the crossplatform MATLAB environment (The Mathworks, Inc.) for processing collections of single-trial and/or averaged EEG data of any number of channels. Available functions include EEG data, channel and event information importing, data visualization (scrolling, scalp map and dipole model plotting, plus multi-trial ERP-image plots), preprocessing (including artifact rejection, filtering, epoch selection, and averaging), independent component analysis (ICA) and time/frequency decompositions including channel and component cross-coherence supported by bootstrap statistical methods based on data resampling. EEGLAB functions are organized into three layers. Top-layer functions allow users to interact with the data through the graphic interface without needing to use MATLAB syntax. Menu options allow users to tune the behavior of EEGLAB to available memory. Middle-layer functions allow users to customize data processing using command history and interactive 'pop' functions. Experienced MATLAB users can use EEGLAB data structures and stand-alone signal processing functions to write custom and/or batch analysis scripts. Extensive function help and tutorial information are included. A 'plug-in' facility allows easy incorporation of new EEG modules into the main menu. EEGLAB is freely available (http://www.sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/) under the GNU public license for noncommercial use and open source development, together with sample data, user tutorial and extensive documentation.},

	abstract = {A method of accurate storage and on-line preprocessing of an EEG signal, preceding and following a trigger signal, elicited by button pressing, is described. The method was used to study the changes occurring in the power of the rhythmic activity within the alpha band in central areas, during voluntary, self-paced movement in 10 normal humans. A short-lasting decrease or phasic event-related desynchronization (ERD) of alpha power, representing mu activity, was observed in all 10 subjects. During the 2 sec period preceding movement the phasic ERD was mostly bilateral, but larger prior to right than to left thumb movement. At onset and during the first second of execution of movement, the phasic ERD was mostly bilateral but predominant in ipsilateral areas. Preceding or during movement, maximum ERD was observed in most cases in central-vertex regions.},

@article{Vanegas2015,
	abstract = {Surround suppression is a well-known example of contextual interaction in visual cortical neurophysiology, whereby the neural response to a stimulus presented within a neuron's classical receptive field is suppressed by surrounding stimuli. Human psychophysical reports present an obvious analog to the effects seen at the single-neuron level: stimuli are perceived as lower-contrast when embedded in a surround. Here we report on a visual paradigm that provides relatively direct, straightforward indices of surround suppression in human electrophysiology, enabling us to reproduce several well-known neurophysiological and psychophysical effects, and to conduct new analyses of temporal trends and retinal location effects. Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) elicited by flickering "foreground" stimuli were measured in the context of various static surround patterns. Early visual cortex geometry and retinotopic organization were exploited to enhance SSVEP amplitude. The foreground response was strongly suppressed as a monotonic function of surround contrast. Furthermore, suppression was stronger for surrounds of matching orientation than orthogonally-oriented ones, and stronger at peripheral than foveal locations. These patterns were reproduced in psychophysical reports of perceived contrast, and peripheral electrophysiological suppression effects correlated with psychophysical effects across subjects. Temporal analysis of SSVEP amplitude revealed short-term contrast adaptation effects that caused the foreground signal to either fall or grow over time, depending on the relative contrast of the surround, consistent with stronger adaptation of the suppressive drive. This electrophysiology paradigm has clinical potential in indexing not just visual deficits but possibly gain control deficits expressed more widely in the disordered brain. },

@article{Hou2020,
	abstract = {During binocular viewing, visual inputs from the two eyes interact at the level of visual cortex. Here we studied binocular interactions in human visual cortex, including both sexes, using source-imaged steady-state visual evoked potentials over a wide range of relative contrast between two eyes. The ROIs included areas V1, V3a, hV4, hMT+, and lateral occipital cortex. Dichoptic parallel grating stimuli in each eye modulated at distinct temporal frequencies allowed us to quantify spectral components associated with the individual stimuli from monocular inputs (self-terms) and responses due to interaction between the inputs from the two eyes (intermodulation [IM] terms). Data with self-terms revealed an interocular suppression effect, in which the responses to the stimulus in one eye were reduced when a stimulus was presented simultaneously to the other eye. The suppression magnitude varied depending on visual area, and the relative contrast between the two eyes. Suppression was strongest in V1 and V3a (50% reduction) and was least in lateral occipital cortex (20% reduction). Data with IM terms revealed another form of binocular interaction, compared with self-terms. IM response was strongest at V1 and was least in hV4. Fits of a family of divisive gain control models to both self- and IM-term responses within each cortical area indicated that both forms of binocular interaction shared a common gain control nonlinearity. However, our model fits revealed different patterns of binocular interaction along the cortical hierarchy, particularly in terms of excitatory and suppressive contributions.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Using source-imaged steady-state visual evoked potentials and frequency-domain analysis of dichoptic stimuli, we measured two forms of binocular interactions: one is associated with the individual stimuli that represent interocular suppression from each eye, and the other is a direct measure of interocular interaction between inputs from the two eyes. We demonstrated that both forms of binocular interactions share a common gain control mechanism in striate and extra-striate cortex. Furthermore, our model fits revealed different patterns of binocular interaction along the visual cortical hierarchy, particularly in terms of excitatory and suppressive contributions.},

@article{Itthipuripat2014,
	abstract = {Over the last several decades, spatial attention has been shown to influence the activity of neurons in visual cortex in various ways. These conflicting observations have inspired competing models to account for the influence of attention on perception and behavior. Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) in human subjects and showed that highly focused spatial attention primarily enhanced neural responses to high-contrast stimuli (response gain), whereas distributed attention primarily enhanced responses to medium-contrast stimuli (contrast gain). Together, these data suggest that different patterns of neural modulation do not reflect fundamentally different neural mechanisms, but instead reflect changes in the spatial extent of attention. },

	abstract = {The balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain affects both neural responses and behaviour in humans and animals. Here we investigated whether dietary intervention aimed at increasing levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) can influence neural responses to basic sensory stimuli. Using a steady-state electroencephalography (EEG) paradigm, we found that the neural response to visual patterns was reduced in individuals who consumed a yeast extract product rich in substances associated with the production of GABA (glutamate and B vitamins), but not in a control group who consumed a placebo substance ( n = 14 per group). This demonstrates that the balance of excitation and inhibition in the brain can be influenced by dietary interventions, suggesting possible clinical benefits in conditions (e.g. epilepsy) where inhibition is abnormal.},

@article{Maris2007,
	abstract = {In this paper, we show how ElectroEncephaloGraphic (EEG) and MagnetoEncephaloGraphic (MEG) data can be analyzed statistically using nonparametric techniques. Nonparametric statistical tests offer complete freedom to the user with respect to the test statistic by means of which the experimental conditions are compared. This freedom provides a straightforward way to solve the multiple comparisons problem (MCP) and it allows to incorporate biophysically motivated constraints in the test statistic, which may drastically increase the sensitivity of the statistical test. The paper is written for two audiences: (1) empirical neuroscientists looking for the most appropriate data analysis method, and (2) methodologists interested in the theoretical concepts behind nonparametric statistical tests. For the empirical neuroscientist, a large part of the paper is written in a tutorial-like fashion, enabling neuroscientists to construct their own statistical test, maximizing the sensitivity to the expected effect. And for the methodologist, it is explained why the nonparametric test is formally correct. This means that we formulate a null hypothesis (identical probability distribution in the different experimental conditions) and show that the nonparametric test controls the false alarm rate under this null hypothesis.},

Although decoding methods have been extensively applied in brain-computer interfaces, these methods have only recently been applied to time series neuroimaging data such as MEG and EEG to address experimental questions in cognitive neuroscience. In a tutorial style review, we describe a broad set of options to inform future time series decoding studies from a cognitive neuroscience perspective. Using example MEG data, we illustrate the effects that different options in the decoding analysis pipeline can have on experimental results where the aim is to "decode" different perceptual stimuli or cognitive states over time from dynamic brain activation patterns. We show that decisions made at both preprocessing (e.g., dimensionality reduction, subsampling, trial averaging) and decoding (e.g., classifier selection, cross-validation design) stages of the analysis can significantly affect the results. In addition to standard decoding, we describe extensions to MVPA for time-varying neuroimaging data including representational similarity analysis, temporal generalization, and the interpretation of classifier weight maps. Finally, we outline important caveats in the design and interpretation of time series decoding experiments.},

Young flies from four control lines were compared to three early-onset PD mutations (PINK1, DJ-1α and DJ-1β), and to two other neurodegenerative mutations, one in the fly LRRK2 orthologue (dLRRK) the other in eggroll, a model of general neurodegeneration in Drosophila. Stimuli were contrast reversing gratings spanning 64 spatiotemporal frequency combinations. We recorded the steady-state visually-evoked response amplitude across all combinations. We found that the pattern of neuronal responses differed between genotypes. Wild-type and early-onset PD flies formed separate clusters; the late-onset mutation is an outlier. Neuronal responses in early-onset PD flies were stronger than in wild-types. Multivariate pattern analysis grouped flies by PD/non-PD genotype with an accuracy >85%. We propose that machine learning algorithms may be useful in increasing the diagnostic specificity of human electrophysiological measurements in both animal models and PD patients.},

As is commonly known, it is not possible to state evidence for the null hypothesis in conventional significance testing. Here we highlight a Bayes factor alternative to the conventional t test that will allow researchers to express preference for either the null hypothesis or the alternative. The Bayes factor has a natural and straightforward interpretation, is based on reasonable assumptions, and has better properties than other methods of inference that have been advocated in the psychological literature. To facilitate use of the Bayes factor, we provide an easy-to-use, Web-based program that performs the necessary calculations.},

In particular, the strength of phase-amplitude CFC differs across brain areas in a task-relevant manner, changes quickly in response to sensory, motor and cognitive events, and correlates with performance in learning tasks. Importantly, whereas high-frequency brain activity reflects local domains of cortical processing, low-frequency brain rhythms are dynamically entrained across distributed brain regions by both external sensory input and internal cognitive events. CFC might thus serve as a mechanism to transfer information from large-scale brain networks operating at behavioral timescales to the fast, local cortical processing required for effective computation and synaptic modification, thus integrating functional systems across multiple spatiotemporal scales.},

	abstract = {1. Spatial summation within cat retinal receptive fields was studied by recording from optic-tract fibres the responses of ganglion cells to grating patterns whose luminance perpendicular to the bars varied sinusoidally about the mean level. 2. Summation over the receptive fields of some cells (X-cells) was found to be approximately linear, while for other cells (Y-cells) summation was very non-linear. 3. The mean discharge frequency of Y-cells (unlike that of X-cells) was greatly increased when grating patterns drifted across their receptive fields. 4. In twenty-one X-cells the relation between the contrast and spatial frequency of drifting sinusoidal gratings which evoked the same small response was measured. In every case it was found that the reciprocal of this relation, the contrast sensitivity function, could be satisfactorily described by the difference of two Gaussian functions. 5. This finding supports the hypothesis that the sensitivities of the antagonistic centre and surround summating regions of ganglion cell receptive fields fall off as Gaussian functions of the distance from the field centre. 6. The way in which the sensitivity of an X-cell for a contrast-edge pattern varied with the distance of the edge from the receptive field centre was determined and found to be consistent with the cell's measured contrast sensitivity function. 7. Reducing the retinal illumination produced changes in the contrast sensitivity function of an X-cell which suggested that the diameters of the summating regions of the receptive field increased while the surround region became relatively ineffective.},

	abstract = {Visually evoked potentials (VEPs) have been recorded from the Wulst surface of the little owl, Athene noctua, in response to counterphase-reversal of sinusoidal gratings with different contrast, spatial frequency and mean luminance, presented either monocularly or binocularly. Monocular full-field stimuli presented to either eye evoked VEPs of similar amplitude, waveform and latency. Under binocular viewing, VEPs approximately doubled in amplitude without waveform changes. VEPs with similar characteristics could be obtained in response to stimulation of the contralateral, but not ipsilateral, hemifield. These results suggest that a 50% recrossing occurs in thalamic efferents and that different ipsilateral and contralateral regions converge onto the same Wulst sites. The VEP amplitude progressively decreased with increase of the spatial frequency beyond 2 cycles/degree, and the high spatial frequency cut-off (VEP acuity) was under binocular viewing (8 cycles/degree) higher than under monocular (5 cycles/degree) viewing (200 cd/m2, 45% contrast). The VEP acuity increased with increase in the contrast and decreased with reduction of the mean luminance. The binocular gain in both VEP amplitude and VEP acuity was largest at the lowest luminance levels. Binocular VEP summation occurred in the medium-high contrast range. With decreased contrast, both monocular and binocular VEPs progressively decreased in amplitude and tended to the same contrast threshold. The VEP contrast threshold depended on the spatial frequency (0.6-1.8% in the range 0.12-2 cycles/degree). Binocular VEPs often showed facilitatory interaction (binocular/monocular amplitude ratio greater than 2), but the binocular VEP amplitude did not change either by changing the stimulus orientation (horizontal vs. vertical gratings) or by inducing different retinal disparities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Macaque monkeys were trained to fixate a small spot while we recorded epidural steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) in response to counterphase modulated sinusoidal gratings. This led to the following results: (1) the SSVEP can show either broad or narrow spatial frequency tuning, depending on electrode location, temporal frequency, contrast and method of analysis. (2) The SSVEP can also show narrow temporal frequency tuning, as narrow as 0.5 octave at half height. (3) Contrast functions relating VEP amplitude to log contrast were highly nonlinear. We propose that they are the composite of at least two distinct linear functions, one with a shallow slope for low contrasts and one with a significantly steeper slope for the higher contrasts. (4) Extrapolation of the low contrast function to zero voltage can lead to an excellent match with psychophysical functions. A similar extrapolation of the high contrast function, however, leads to a contrast value much higher than the psychophysical threshold. These findings suggest that the SSVEP can reflect the activity of two distinct neural mechanisms responsive to pattern stimulation. The degree to which either mechanism is evident determines the spatial and temporal frequency tuning of the VEP.},

@article{Morrone1987,
	abstract = {Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were recorded from cat cortex (area 17) before, during and after application of the GABA blocker bicuculline (iontophoretic or topical). The stimuli comprised a test sinusoidal grating, and a mask grating oriented either parallel or orthogonal to the test. Both test and mask alternated in contrast at different temporal frequencies. VEPs were averaged in synchrony with the test contrast reversal, so the mask did not contribute directly to the averaged VEP response. Before application of bicuculline, both parallel and orthogonal masks attenuated the amplitude of VEPs and changed the phase response, but in different ways. Orthogonal masks lowered the slope of the contrast response curve without affecting extrapolated threshold, while parallel masks caused the curve to shift to the right. Orthogonal masks increased the phase advance, while parallel masks eliminated it. During application of bicuculline, neither parallel nor the orthogonal masks attenuated VEP amplitudes. The results suggest that although the mechanisms for the action of parallel and orthogonal masks are clearly distinct, both are mediated by the GABA-ergic inhibitory system. Given this evidence, measurement of VEP contrast response curves may provide a simple non-invasive technique for monitoring visual inhibition in humans.},

@article{Rees1986,
	abstract = {Steady-state potentials evoked in response to binaural, sinusoidally amplitude-modulated (AM) pure tones and broadband noise signals were recorded differentially from position F4 and the ipsilateral mastoid on the human scalp. The responses elicited by the AM stimuli were approximately periodic waveforms whose energy was predominantly at the modulation frequency of the stimulus. The magnitude of responses was between 0.1 and 4 microV for modulation frequencies between 2 and 400 Hz imposed on a 1-kHz carrier signal. The magnitude of the responses increased linearly with log modulation depth for low (4 Hz) and high (80 Hz) modulation rates. The response magnitude also increased linearly with the mean intensity of the sound for intensities up to 60 dB above the subject's pure tone threshold; at higher levels the response saturated. The relationship between response magnitude and modulation frequency (the modulation transfer function) was a lowpass function for both pure tone and broadband noise carrier signals. The modulation transfer functions were similar to those obtained from human psychophysical measurements where spectral cues are either unavailable or not used by the subject. The responses also contained a significant component at the second harmonic of the modulation frequency. The magnitude of this component was greatest at modulation rates between 5 and 20 Hz. The responses elicited by ipsilateral and contralateral monaural stimulation were approximately equal in magnitude, and binaural stimulation produced a potential 30% greater than the individual monaural responses. It is suggested that the evoked response represents the entrained neural activity to temporal amplitude fluctuations, and reflects the psychophysically measured performance of the auditory system for the detection and analysis of amplitude modulation.},

How these patterns of activity are modulated by subcortical arousal systems is poorly understood. Here, we couple selective optogenetic stimulation of a defined subcortical cell-type, basal forebrain (BF) parvalbumin (PV) neurons, with hdEEG recordings in mice (Opto-hdEEG). Stimulation of BF PV projection neurons preferentially generated time-locked gamma oscillations in frontal cortices. BF PV gamma-frequency stimulation potently modulated an auditory sensory paradigm used to probe cortical function in neuropsychiatric disorders, the auditory steady-state response (ASSR). Phase-locked excitation of BF PV neurons in advance of 40 Hz auditory stimuli enhanced the power, precision and reliability of cortical responses, and the relationship between responses in frontal and auditory cortices. Furthermore, synchronization within a frontal hub and long-range cortical interactions were enhanced. Thus, phasic discharge of BF PV neurons changes cortical processing in a manner reminiscent of global workspace models of attention and consciousness.},

	abstract = {There is increasing evidence for a strong genetic basis for autism, with many genetic models being developed in an attempt to replicate autistic symptoms in animals. However, current animal behaviour paradigms rarely match the social and cognitive behaviours exhibited by autistic individuals. Here, we instead assay another functional domain-sensory processing-known to be affected in autism to test a novel genetic autism model in Drosophila melanogaster. We show similar visual response alterations and a similar development trajectory in Nhe3 mutant flies (total n = 72) and in autistic human participants (total n = 154). We report a dissociation between first- and second-order electrophysiological visual responses to steady-state stimulation in adult mutant fruit flies that is strikingly similar to the response pattern in human adults with ASD as well as that of a large sample of neurotypical individuals with high numbers of autistic traits. We explain this as a genetically driven, selective signalling alteration in transient visual dynamics. In contrast to adults, autistic children show a decrease in the first-order response that is matched by the fruit fly model, suggesting that a compensatory change in processing occurs during development. Our results provide the first animal model of autism comprising a differential developmental phenotype in visual processing.},

Functional magnetic resonance images were recorded during phase-encoded retinal stimulation. This volume data set was then sampled with a cortical surface reconstruction, making it possible to calculate the local visual field sign (mirror image versus non-mirror image representation). This method automatically and objectively outlines area borders because adjacent areas often have the opposite field sign. Cortical magnification factor curves for striate and extrastriate cortical areas were determined, which showed that human visual areas have a greater emphasis on the center-of-gaze than their counterparts in monkeys. Retinotopically organized visual areas in humans extend anteriorly to overlap several areas previously shown to be activated by written words.},

	abstract = {To create neural representations of external stimuli, the brain performs a number of processing steps that transform its inputs. For fundamental attributes, such as stimulus contrast, this involves one or more nonlinearities that are believed to optimise the neural code to represent features of the natural environment. Here we ask if the same is also true of more complex stimulus dimensions, such as emotional facial expression. We report the results of three experiments combining morphed facial stimuli with electrophysiological and psychophysical methods to measure the function mapping emotional expression intensity to internal response. The results converge on a nonlinearity that accelerates over weak expressions, and then becomes shallower for stronger expressions, similar to the situation for lower level stimulus properties. We further demonstrate that the nonlinearity is not attributable to the morphing procedure used in stimulus generation.},

We have developed a visually evoked potential (VEP) technique which isolates the response of orientation-selective mechanisms from that of cortical or sub-cortical neurones which lack orientation selectivity. We are unable to find such orientation-selective responses in newborn human infants within the sensitivity of our method, but repeated longitudinal testing of individual infants shows that measurable responses emerge around 6 weeks of age. This result is consistent with the idea that human cortical visual function is very immature at birth, but develops rapidly in the first two postnatal months.},

@article{Liu-Shuang2014,
	abstract = {We introduce an approach based on fast periodic oddball stimulation that provides objective, high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and behavior-free measures of the human brain's discriminative response to complex visual patterns. High-density electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded for human observers presented with 60s sequences containing a base-face (A) sinusoidally contrast-modulated at a frequency of 5.88 Hz (F), with face size varying every cycle. Different oddball-faces (B, C, D...) were introduced at fixed intervals (every 4 stimuli = F/5 = 1.18 Hz: AAAABAAAACAAAAD...). Individual face discrimination was indexed by responses at this 1.18 Hz oddball frequency. Following only 4 min of recording, significant responses emerged at exactly 1.18 Hz and its harmonics (e.g., 2F/5 = 2.35 Hz, 3F/5 = 3.53 Hz...), with up to a 300% signal increase over the right occipito-temporal cortex. This response was present in all participants, for both color and greyscale faces, providing a robust implicit neural measure of individual face discrimination. Face inversion or contrast-reversal did not affect the basic 5.88 Hz periodic response over medial occipital channels. However, these manipulations substantially reduced the 1.18 Hz oddball discrimination response over the right occipito-temporal region, indicating that this response reflects high-level processes that are partly face-specific. These observations indicate that fast periodic oddball stimulation can be used to rapidly and objectively characterize the discrimination of visual patterns and may become invaluable in characterizing this process in typical adult, developmental, and neuropsychological patient populations.},

@article{Afsari2014,
	abstract = {Our understanding of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been revolutionized by the discovery of disease-causing genetic mutations. The most common of these is the G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 kinase gene, which leads to increased kinase activity. However, the link between increased kinase activity and PD is unclear. Previously, we showed that dopaminergic expression of the human LRRK2-G2019S transgene in flies led to an activity-dependent loss of vision in older animals and we hypothesized that this may have been preceded by a failure to regulate neuronal activity correctly in younger animals. To test this hypothesis, we used a sensitive measure of visual function based on frequency-tagged steady-state visually evoked potentials. Spectral analysis allowed us to identify signals from multiple levels of the fly visual system and wild-type visual response curves were qualitatively similar to those from human cortex. Dopaminergic expression of hLRRK2-G2019S increased contrast sensitivity throughout the retinal network. To test whether this was due to increased kinase activity, we fed Drosophila with kinase inhibitors targeted at LRRK2. Contrast sensitivity in both day 1 and day 14 flies was normalized by a novel LRRK2 kinase inhibitor 'BMPPB-32'. Biochemical and cellular assays suggested that BMPPB-32 would be a more specific kinase inhibitor than LRRK2-IN-1. We confirmed this in vivo, finding that dLRRK(-) null flies show large off-target effects with LRRK2-IN-1 but not BMPPB-32. Our data link the increased Kinase activity of the G2019S-LRRK2 mutation to neuronal dysfunction and demonstrate the power of the Drosophila visual system in assaying the neurological effects of genetic diseases and therapies. },

@article{Pei2017,
	abstract = {Contrast sensitivity is regulated by neural mechanisms that flexibly adjust responsiveness to optimize stimulus encoding across different environments. Here we studied the developmental status of gain control mechanisms in school-age children (5-17years) and adults using a visual masking paradigm. A variable contrast, spatially random 2-D noise test pattern was masked by the presence of a superimposed independent noise pattern presented at 0, 12 and 40% contrast. Frequency-tagged steady state visual evoked potentials were used to separately record responses to the test (5.14Hz) and the mask (7.2Hz). By incrementally increasing the test contrast we measured contrast response functions for each mask contrast. The unmasked contrast response functions were largely similar in shape across age, but peak amplitude was higher in the children. Masking shifted the contrast response function rightward on the contrast axis in both the adults and older children, elevating contrast thresholds by a similar factor across age. However, in younger children, masking resulted in a change in the slope of the contrast response function. These findings suggest that immaturity in the contrast normalization process persists until approximately 11years of age.},

@article{Spitschan2014,
	abstract = {In the human, cone photoreceptors (L, M, and S) and the melanopsin-containing, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are active at daytime light intensities. Signals from cones are combined both additively and in opposition to create the perception of overall light and color. Similar mechanisms seem to be at work in the control of the pupil's response to light. Uncharacterized however, is the relative contribution of melanopsin and S cones, with their overlapping, short-wavelength spectral sensitivities. We measured the response of the human pupil to the separate stimulation of the cones and melanopsin at a range of temporal frequencies under photopic conditions. The S-cone and melanopsin photoreceptor channels were found to be low-pass, in contrast to a band-pass response of the pupil to L- and M-cone signals. An examination of the phase relationships of the evoked responses revealed that melanopsin signals add with signals from L and M cones but are opposed by signals from S cones in control of the pupil. The opposition of the S cones is revealed in a seemingly paradoxical dilation of the pupil to greater S-cone photon capture. This surprising result is explained by the neurophysiological properties of ipRGCs found in animal studies. },

This statistic, denoted T2circ, is based on the same physiologic assumptions concerning the sources of variability of a Fourier component that are made in the use of the Rayleigh phase-coherence statistic as well as the standard T2 statistic (Hotelling 1931) for multivariate data. However, the T2circ statistic also exploits the relationship between the real and imaginary components of Fourier estimates, which is not exploited by T2, and utilizes amplitude information, which is ignored by the Rayleigh criterion. For these reasons, the T2circ statistic is more efficient than previously used criteria for detection and quantitation of steady-state responses, both in principle and in practice.},
