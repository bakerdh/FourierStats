Description: The FourierStats package implements several statistical tests for use with bivariate data such as the complex (real and imaginary) components of the Fourier spectrum. Included functions implement the T-squared-circ test of Victor & Mast (1991), and the condition index and ANOVA-squared-circ described by Baker (2021).
